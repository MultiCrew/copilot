<p>
    MultiCrew is a community driven and funded recreational flight
    simulation organisation. We specialise in shared cockpit services by
    providing: unofficial support, means to organise and coordinate shared
    cockpit and group flights, flight simulator training and online network
    “type ratings”, and more.
</p>
<p>
    MultiCrew is not a provider of real-world flight instruction or examinations
    and nothing which you find on our website should <strong>ever</strong> be
    used in relation to flying a real aircraft in the real world - doing so is
    both unsafe and unlawful.
</p>
<p>
    At MultiCrew, we have both a personal and legal obligation to protect our
    users’ privacy and ensure we are clear and transparent about what data we
    collect, how we use this data and how we keep it safe. Whilst the collection
    and storage of limited personal information is necessary, it is kept
    securely and to a minimum.

    from the email address you wish to be removed from mailing lists. You will

    passwords, etc.) are stored in a secured database on MultiCrew’s rented
    server and is not accessible by anyone who is not an authorised member of
    the MultiCrew team. MultiCrew and its development team will <em>never</em>

    users will be given a copy of all the data which MultiCrew holds about them,
    in compliance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation.

<h3>Code of Conduct</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        Users must be respectful to all other users and, in particular, respect
        the staff members at MultiCrew.
    </li>
    <li>
        Upon registration for a MultiCrew account, users must provide accurate
        and truthful information, including a real and verified email address.
    </li>
    <li>
        Users may only register one MultiCrew account per person.
    </li>
    <li>
        Users should not use any of the MultiCrew social media or messaging
        services to offend, discriminate against or defame other users.
    </li>

</ol>

<h5>Conflict Resolution</h5>
<p>
    As a community-based organisation, MultiCrew prides itself on maintaining a
    positive and constructive community base. However, not all users will
    respect that policy, and as such matters which we will refer to as
    "conflicts" may arise. The following policy outlines what we define as a
    "conflict", and how these situations are resolved.
</p>
<h6>Conflicts</h6>
<p>
    Conflict exists in all over the world and, in its best form, can be an
    indicator of a positive exchange of ideas and opinions. However,
    particularly on the Internet, conflict often becomes counter-productive and
    can result in user dissatisfaction, poor services and, overall, a reduction
    in the quality of the community environment.
</p>
<p>
    At MultiCrew, we believe a "conflict" to be a breach any of the policies
    laid out on this page.
</p>

<h5>Resolution</h5>
<p>
    Conflicts will always be resolved by the senior members of staff with an
    oversight of the organisation in its entirety, with a view to maintaining a
    positive community environment. Staff will utilise a number of tools to
    resolve conflicts, detailed below.
</p>

<h6>Warnings</h6>
<p>
    The first method employed will be a warning. This will be communicated to
    the user by the most convenient method possible: either by email, Discord
    DM or other appropriate communication protocol. A warning will be used in
    the event of an accidental or non-malicious breach of terms. A warning will
    not have any direct implications; it is simply a reminder to the user that
    they may have breached the terms.
</p>
<h6>Bans</h6>
<p>
    Following a repeated or severe breach of the terms, it may be necessary to
    ban a user from the MultiCrew community. Bans vary in length, from 1 day to
    indefinite. In the event of a ban, a user will no longer have access to web
    services or the Discord server.
</p>

<h5>Disputes</h5>
<p>
    In the event of a ban being employed to resolve a conflict, users are
    permitted to dispute the ban provided that the duration of the ban is
    greater than 1 day.
</p>
<p>
    In order to dispute the ban, users will have to contact the community
    administrators and provide substantial evidence to support their dispute and
    prove that they have good reason to have their ban lifted.
</p>
<p>
    Disputes for bans of less than 1 day, or without substantial supporting
    evidence, will be ignored!
</p>

<h3>Changes to our Terms and Policies</h3>
<p>
    From time to time, MultiCrew may make adjustments, add or remove to and from
    the Terms and Policies on this web page. This web page may also move
    location on the website, however, will always be clearly signposted and
    linked to in naviagtion elements and other appropriate locations from within
    the User Interfaces and website. The alterations described above may happen
    at any time, however, registered users will <strong>always</strong> be
    informed at their registered email address.
